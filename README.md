Use `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereada` to build website from directory in terminal. Testing.

# Getting Started

New machine? Follow [this](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/) guide to get started with Ruby (use rbenv). And [this](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) guide for Jekyll.

# Notes

Was having issues with `bibliography` when using Ruby 3.1.2 so changed to 2.7.6 and works.
