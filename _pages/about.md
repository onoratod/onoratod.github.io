I am a first year PhD student studying economics at Columbia University. My broad research interests are in labor and economic history with a focus on racial and income inequality. I am also interested in how social networks affect various outcomes such as economic mobility, prison re-entry, etc.

Prior to starting my PhD I attended undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania, worked as a pre-doctoral fellow at Opportunity Insights, and worked as a research assistant for Professor Dave Donaldson.
